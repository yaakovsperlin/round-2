			The Think Different campaign in 1997 is probably one of the most memorable ads for anything. This is where Apple's brand of being something special, something for the dreamers, the risk-takers, the creatives, and the move-makers became prominent. This narration in the original ad was done by Richard Dreyfuss, but there is a Steve Jobs narrated one (that never aired) that I think hits the mark a little better and here it is.
