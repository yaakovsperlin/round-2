	<h1>Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, U.S. He was adopted and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He had a younger sister, Patricia.

As a child, Steve liked reading, swimming, music, and practical jokes. He also spent a lot of time building electronics. As a young teenager, he got a summer job at an electronics company. In high school, he joined an electronics club whose members were called “wireheads.”

In 1972 Jobs went to college for less than a year. In 1974 he worked at Atari, a video-game company. Later that year, he began working with an old friend named Stephen Wozniak.
